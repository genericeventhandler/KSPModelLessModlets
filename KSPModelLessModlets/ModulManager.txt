The general form of a patch for values is

<Op><Name-With-Wildcards>(,<index>)?

So breaking this down

<Op> One of
nothing for insert
@ for edit
+ or $ for copy
- or ! for delete
% for edit-or-create.
<Name-With-Wildcards> : The name of the value you'll be messing with. Wildcards are not always available for every Op. Wildcards include ? for any character, and * for any number of chars. Note that ''only alphanumeric chars'' are allowed in value names for patches. If you have spaces or any other char, use a ? to match it.
(,<index>)? : Optional index. Again, not available with every option. Not that these indexes are ''with respect to all name matches'' not the total index in the node. I will support negative indexes for running backwards through the list soon. Also * is not yet supported.
The general form for nodes is:

<Op><NodeType>([<NodeNameWithWildcards>])?(:HAS[<has block>])?(,<index-or-*>)?

<Op> : Operator, as above
<NodeType> : typically MODULE or something like it. Wildcards not allowed (I can't imagine you'd need them)
([<NodeNameWithWildcards>])? : This is a wildcard match for the name = <name> value within the node. Optional. This is equivalent to :HAS[#name[<NodeNameWithWildcards>]], which means it will exclude any nodes which do not have names (there aren't many, but they do exist). This means that FOOBAR[*] will not select all nodes of type FOOBAR, but all nodes of type FOOBAR which have a defined "name" field. (If you want to select all FOOBAR nodes, use FOOBAR,*.)
(:HAS[<has block>])? : Optional has block. You can't (currently) use indexes with HAS. This has been described previously. If this is present then all matches will be matched, there's no indexing available currently.
(,<index-or-*>)? : Index to select particular match zero based. 0 is the first node, -1 is last node. Values 'off the end' will match the end, so large positive matches the end and large negative matches the beginning. Again this matches ''against everything the wildcard selects in order''. * here will match everything.
